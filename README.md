## Home/Login Page
The home/login page is stylized like a classic tourism website home page. A white box with fields for Username and Password is presented to the user to fill in. If the user is brand new, they will fill in the fields and click the Create Acccount button. The user is created in the backend and the user is redirected to the search page. If the user already has an account, they can fill in the fileds and click the login button to sign into their existing account.

## Search Page
Once the user is authenticated through the Home/Login page, they are shown a search page with two sides. The left side contains a dropdown list of locations for the user to choose from. The right sidebar contains placeholder items of helpful tourism resources - Dine with Us, Explore with Us, and Stay with Us.
The user then selects a location. The page will now show a beautiful photograph overlooking the locale on the left side and the right side will populates a list of 3 popular tourist excursions, activities, eateries, etc. in the area.

You can add to your favorites by selecting heart icon on bottom right corner of each activity on the right side. Upon clicking the heart icon, it turns red to indicate it has been added to your favorites list. The user is able to save up to 6 favorites in this manner. This activity will populate in your favorites section of your user page. To navigate to that page, click the settings icon on the bottom left of the entire page.

## User Page

The left profile bar on this page shows the name of the user appended to "favorites" to indicate that this page shows the user's saved favorites. At the bottom of this left profile bar, there is a Search button that redirects you to the Search page (page2.html). Directly underneath the prior button, there is also a Logout button that redirects to you the Home/Login page (home.html).

On the right user favorites section, there are 6 areas that have plus buttons that redirect you to the search page to be able to look up to locations and favorite more activities. The names of the locations that have been favorited are populated on that right favorites screen in one of the 6 areas.
